Berkerley DB replication can support automatic leader election, fail over and
various consistency policies.
The frontend has to differenciate which backed is currently master though, which
can be achived by a notification when the bdb instance becomes master or a query
after finding the old master is dead.
Memcachedb is one such example that uses BDB and replication to build a real
world datastore. However I think it can also be used as a common HA, high
performance in memory db that is a building block for various stateful services.
